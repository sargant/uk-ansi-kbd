# UK ANSI keyboard layout for Windows

A simple keyboard layout that makes using a US ANSI keyboard in the UK a bit more bearable:

* `Alt Gr + 3` ➡️ `£`
* `Alt Gr + 4` ➡️ `4`

Everything else is as labelled on a standard US ANSI keyboard layout.

## How to use

Run the correct `.msi` for your system architecture, or just run `setup.exe` to automatically detect & install.

After installation, you will find an extra keyboard language installed for the **English (United Kingdom)** region.

To switch keyboard layouts, change it in Windows settings, or press `Win + Spacebar` to change quickly.
